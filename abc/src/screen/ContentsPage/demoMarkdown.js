Before the World Wide Web (WWW) as we now know, there was web 1.0 in the period roughly between 1991 to 2004. Websites were designed to display information in a static format. Information could be presented without geographical restrictions as one-way communication, with a read-only format.

With Web 2.0, the internet took a turn towards an interactive community-focused space, as opposed to the company focus it had prior. Web pages in this iteration are typically read-write, and interaction and collaboration were made possible with social media, blogs and podcasts. This version of the web emerged in the 2000s and is the current version of the internet.

Web 3.0 is the version of the web that some have described as the future of the internet. The idea for web3 relies on token-based economics and decentralisation, unlike web 1.0 and web 2.0 which both operated on a centralised model. Also known as the [Semantic Web](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Web-30), it's a concept that uses artificial intelligence for things such as virtual assistants and chatbots, which are already emerging as Siri, ChatGPT etc., and filtering data, to separate legitimate and falsified data. It will focus on peer-to-peer technologies, open-source software and open APIs.

Web3's visions include transparent code, individuals having greater control of their data, managing their own credentials, and decentralised finance.

The main benefits of Web3 are:

1. **OWNERSHIP:** Web3 is powered by blockchain technology and decentralisation, democratising content creation and eliminating the middleman. Web2 relies on social media sites to store, distribute, and benefit from content. Web3, in contrast, allows users to earn tokens for their community participation and activity directly. These tokens have actual monetary value and give users meaningful ownership of their projects.

1. **PRIVACY:** A decentralised identity system allows you to control your online identity and personal information. In Web3 you get more fine-tuned control over what information is available about you online and who can access it. Moreover, you get a cryptographically secure way to prove whether the information is accurate.

1. **SECURITY:** Unlike the current system, where information can easily be copied or stolen without the user knowing, blockchain technology is secure and tamperproof; data cannot be changed or hacked without the interference being detected. However, there might be many unsecured web3 applications, and it is recommended only to use audited web3 applications.

1. **OPPORTUNITY:** Web3 projects are open source, and anyone can build on top of other projects. Web 2.0 worked with limited API access, but Web 3 works like Lego blocks, where every part can be interconnected and reused. This is called "[composability](https://beincrypto.com/why-composability-is-the-heart-of-web3/)" This paves the way for leveraging existing projects to create something new, making it easy to generate innovative new projects with real value.

1. **COLLABORATION:** Web3 runs on a [DAO](https://consensys.net/blog/blockchain-explained/what-is-a-dao-and-how-do-they-work/) (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), a new management model without boards and executives. DAOs instead operate according to a set of rules written in code,a.k.a [smart contracts](https://medium.com/@cloudtechgroup/are-smart-contracts-the-next-step-in-the-evolution-of-law-328fa680fc6b) which allows an unlimited number of people to participate in it. It is estimated that many traditional companies will change their operating model to DAOs in the next 10 â€“ 15 years.

Leading projects or protocols in the Web3 movement are projects such as crypto currency exchange platforms, both centralised ([OKX](https://www.okx.com/)) and decentralised ([UniSwap](https://uniswap.org/)) ,web browsers with blockchain integration ([Brave](https://brave.com/)) and DApp platforms ([Polygon Network](https://www.polygon.technology/)). These are just a few examples of an ever growing number of applications built to make the most of the advantages that come with building on the blockchain.

However some warn of trends of monopoly building, exploitation and value extraction in some projects, that will crowd out worthier developments. Forrester advises "[extreme caution](https://www.forrester.com/report/web3-promises-a-better-online-future-but-contains-the-seeds-of-a-dystopian-nightmare/RES177246)" when considering Web3 projects, advising execs to make sure they understand exactly who profits from a project, and in what currency, and to consider the governance and privacy issues created by sharing customer info on a blockchain. The distrust towards web3 has only been exacerbated by the Terra and FTX collapse which lead to the '[crypto winter](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/feature/Crypto-winter-explained-Everything-you-need-to-know)' but it is to be noted that it was sheer greediness and villainous activities by the guilty parties, not the fault of the blockchain.

Despite this, transparency, decentralisation and tokenomics of web 3.0 are truly the way of the future, and such concerns are not unique but rather found in all emerging technologies.
